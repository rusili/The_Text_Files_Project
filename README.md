# The Text Files Project

This is a README.md file for the repository `text_files`, containing the following files (using a bulleted list):
* chapter_01.txt
* chapter_02.txt
* chapter_03.txt

This is the same content, but in the form of a numbered list:
1. chapter_01.txt
1. chapter_02.txt
1. chapter_03.txt

### Random Code Section

This is an example of a code block:

	```java
	class Main {
	    public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("This is a block of valid Java code.");
	    }
	}
	```
